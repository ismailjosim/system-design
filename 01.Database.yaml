In NoSQL database system databases are grouped into four categories:
  1. key-value stores,
  2. graph stores,
  3. column stores,
  4. and document stores.

Relational databases exist are over 40 years and historically, they have worked well.

Non-relational databases might be the right choice if:
  • Your application requires super-low latency.
  • Your data are unstructured, or you do not have any relational data.
  • You only need to serialize and deserialize data (JSON, XML, YAML, etc.).
  • You need to store a massive amount of data.
