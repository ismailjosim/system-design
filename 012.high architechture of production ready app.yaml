# the hight level architecture of a production ready app:
key areas:
  - CI/CD Pipeline

## CI/CD Pipeline
* meaning Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment/Delivery
* our code goes from our repository through a series of tests and Pipeline. checks and on to the production server without any manual intervention
* Configured with  platforms like Jenkins or  GitHub actions. for automating or Deployment process.

once our app is in production it handle thousands of requests. this manages by our load balancer and reverse proxies like Ngenx.

- it make sure that user requests are evenly distributed across multiple servers maintaining a smooth user experience even during traffic specs

- for data storing an external server that is not running on the same production server. instead it connected over a network
